<h2 align = 'center'> In2Science Activity Week 25/07/2022 - 29/07/2022</h2>

**Overview of the event.**

The aim of the week is to introduce students with an interest in STEM to data science techniques. The week consists of an initial introduction day, in which students shall be taught the basics of python and jupyter notebooks. We shall then introduce machine learning in a notebook which guides students through the process of setting up and training a simple model which aims to classify the hand-written digits of the MNIST dataset. On Wednesday and Thursday, the students shall be introduced to the task of discerning Higgs boson decays from background events, initially using a 'cut-based' approach, in which dataframes are directly modified, followed by a nerual network approach. On the Friday, the students shall prepare and present a ~5 minute presentation on the work they achieved, with a small prize being given to the winner.

Each of the first 4 days has an associated jupyter-notebook that the students shall work through and modify. They are summarised below:
