    "# 1.1 Searching for $H\\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the primary physics objectives of the Large Hadron Collider is to study the Higgs Boson and understand the process with which particles acquire mass. The Higgs Boson's decays channels along with the respective branching ratios are shown in the figure below. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://physicsforme.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/higgs_decay.jpg\" width=\"400\" />\n",

    "In 2012 the Higgs Boson was discovered in the $H\\rightarrow\\gamma\\gamma$ and $H\\rightarrow ZZ \\rightarrow 4l$. The plot below shows a clear excess of signal events over background around 125 GeV in the $H\\rightarrow ZZ \\rightarrow 4l$ 'golden channel'. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But if the Higgs Boson predominantly decays to a pair of $b$-quarks, why wasn't it discovered in the $H\\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ channel? \n",
    "\n",
    "The discovery channels leave a clean signature in the detector that is easy to isolate making searches in the $H\\rightarrow\\gamma\\gamma$ or $H\\rightarrow ZZ \\rightarrow 4l$ favourable. However, $H\\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ searches aren't so straightforward!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Large background \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the $H\\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ process at the LHC has enourmous amount of background with final states that are the same as the signal i.e. two $b$-quarks. The figure below shows the cross sections (likelihood) of a Higgs event and compared to a bb event at the LHC. In the LHC current operational energy, only around 1 in a trillion proton-proton collisions create a Higgs boson. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../docs/images/lhc_cross_sections.png\" width=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the signal can get drowned out in with the signal-like background. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Jet Production\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, precisely measuring and distinguishing $b$-quarks from say $c$-quarks is also challenging. When a pair of $b$-quarks is created in the ATLAS detector they go through a process known as hadronisation and form [jets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMH3T05G\\_to). The jets must be identified as originating from b-quarks (b-jets) by a process known as $b$-tagging. This extra level of complexity along with the large background makes searches for $H\\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ challenging. "
