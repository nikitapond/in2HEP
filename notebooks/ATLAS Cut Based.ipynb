    "\n",
    "To provide a simple baseline analysis, which can be used to compare a multivariate based analysis to, a set of selection cuts on the kinematic and topological paramaters first needs to be optimised. The goal is to apply cuts that maximise the _signal sensitivity_. Cuts should be applied on all variables other than $m_{bb}$, as the $m_{bb}$ distribution is used to evalute the _signal sensitivity_, which is calculated on a bin-by-bin basis from a given distribution ($m_{bb}$ is the most sensitive single variable, so in the absence of a multivariate approach, it is the best single variable to use to distinguish signal from background).\n",

    "# 2.1 Why do we apply cuts?\n",
    "\n",
    "In particle physics, we want to try and find some evidence of a signal process, such as the production of a Higgs boson, which then decays to 2 b-jets. We do this by measuring the final particles, the b-jets, and then adding up their properties to find the properties of the Higgs. By doing this, we can find properties such as the Higgs mass. In the first example below, we show an ideal case, where we have a lot of Higgs bosons produced, and no background."

We also only generated a single variable, the sum of the mass of the two b-jets. In real data, each point represents an event in the ATLAS detector. But how do we know if the cuts we're applying are working? The way we do this is to instead work with simulations, and compare these to what we see in the data. These are called Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations, as they involve random numbers, as they simulate quantum processes which have an intrinstic random nature. When we generate MC, we know what processes we have generated, and so we can plot all the different background and signal events with different colours, to make it clear what each processes is contributing.
